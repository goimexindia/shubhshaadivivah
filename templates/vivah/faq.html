                    <p><strong> A1. How to register on shubhshaadivivah.com?</strong></p>
                    <p> Registering on shubhshaadivivah.com is simple & completely free. The profile can be created by
                        the person
                        intended to get married, his/her parents, relatives or friends for him. Any person of legal age
                        who intends to find a life partner can register.
                        Registration can be done using the shubhshaadivivah website, mobile (Android/iOS) or tablet.
                        Start by
                        entering basic details of the bride/groom-to-be, following which there will be a mandatory
                        mobile verification. Once the mobile number is successfully verified, fill in the rest of your
                        profile to complete the registration process. A profile ID will be generated automatically.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong> A2. What are the Benefits of having a complete profile?</strong></p>
                    <p> The registration forms on ShubhShaadiVivah.com are designed to include all important information
                        about
                        the
                        person intending to get married which can be of interest to a prospective partner. Members can
                        know
                        more about you before they initiate contact.
                        You can update your profile as and when you have time. Complete the registration very fast by
                        keying
                        in just the mandatory fields, marked by an asterisk.</p>

                    <p><strong>A3. Can I use the same mobile number & Email Id for multiple registrations?</strong></p>
                    <p>No. Mobile number & email address is unique for every profile & hence cannot be used to create/
                        update another profile. This is to provide enhanced security from fake users.</p>

                    <p><strong> A4. Will my Email Id and mobile number be accessible to everyone?</strong></p>
                    <p>No. The Email Id that you specify is the one to which ShubhShaadiVivah will send you all
                        communication
                        from
                        prospective partners. The contact details that you provide will be shared only with subscribers
                        to
                        the site who are interested in your profile as a prospective partner. This will help to speed up
                        contact especially for members who do not use online as a primary medium for communication.</p>

                    <p><strong> A5. How do I add more info than what is required in the registration form?</strong></p>
                    <p>We suggest that you add such specific information in the About Myself column. This field is
                        designed
                        to showcase who you are. But if you find for example that the caste that you belong to is not
                        listed
                        on the form, you can use the 'Others' feature.
                        If you think that the category is critical to be listed, please mail us on
                        sales@shubhshaadivivah.com.
                        We
                        shall respond to you on whether we can include the same.</p>

                        You

                        members. Alternatively, you can add photos from ‘Manage Photos’ section in My Account page.
                        Profiles
                        with photos generate more interest and increase your chances of getting contacted.</p>

                    <p><strong> B4. Can I change the photos that I have uploaded?</strong></p>
                    <p>Yes. You can change your photos using ‘Manage Photos’ in Edit My Profile page.</p>

                    <p><strong> B5. How do I upload Horoscope in my profile?</strong></p>

                        2. Introduction Video
                        3. Horoscope
                        4. Identity Proof</p>
                    <p><strong> B8. Why do I need to add a partner preference in my registration?</strong></p>
                    <p>Your partner preferences will give members an idea whether they match with your expectations.
                        More
                        importantly, your periodical match watch alerts and new match alerts are built on the
                        information
                        provided in your partner profile.

                        While creating your partner profile, please ensure that you do not input too many parameters;
                        chances are you may not obtain optimum results. For eg.: if you define desirable height range as
                        160
                        to 165, you could miss out on a lot of matching profiles.</p>

                    <p><strong>B9. How can I change the information I submitted at registration?</strong></p>
                    You can change information added at registration by clicking ‘Edit my Profile’ on your My Account
                    Page.

                    <p><strong>B10. What are Trust Badges?</strong></p>
                    <p>Trust badges add credibility to members. Add trust badges to ensure more responses.

                        The 3 badges are:

                        Identity Badge
                        Please upload a copy of your Identity proof to enable Identity Badge.

                        profile with the verified stamp.

                        The contact details can only be viewed by the paid members.</p>

                    <p><strong> B11. Why are some of my profile details entered marked in red?</strong></p>
                    <p>All content that you have entered is manually screened & validated for objectionable matter. The
                        fields are not shown & marked in red till they are approved by the ShubhShaadiVivah admin.

                        The approval is very fast, and you need to be patient for a maximum of 24 hours before they are
                        approved and displayed.</p>

                    <p><strong>B12. Why can't I view my attachments immediately?</strong></p>
                    <p>All attachments are validated manually before they are updated. This may be a reason why you
                        can't
                        view uploads immediately. Please avoid objectionable content in your attachments. Please refer
                        to
                        our terms of use for pointers on what is objectionable.</p>
