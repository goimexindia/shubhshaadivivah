                                later
                                call you back from a different number.</h3><br><br>

                                You can easily have an idea of a fraud person before contacting or meeting him/her. The
                                following type of person may be fraud who:</p>

                                <p>(i) Hesitate to share family deatils/ workplace details.</p>

                                <p>(ii) Express "love" too quickly even before fully understanding each other.</p>

                                <p>(iii) The profile looks too good to be true for that person to express interest to
                                    you.
                                <p></p>

                                <p>(iv) call you from multiple numbers. They usually don't give a number to call back.
                                    Even
                                    if they give a number, they don't pick up when you call. Later, they call you back
                                    from
                                    a new number.</p>

                                <p>(v) only give Whats-App* number and prefers to exchange whats-App* numbers, because
                                    they
                                    know Whats-App* keeps on working even on very old closed numbers.</p>

                                <p>(vi) Sound inconsistent or confusing when you ask for personal details</p>

                                <p>(vii) is in a mad rush for early marriage, without a valid reason.</p>

                                <p>(x) Come up with false stories to gain your sympathy</p>
